DataPulse: Automated Data Analysis Platform
Developed by Maharshi TripathiLinkedIn: www.linkedin.com/in/maharshi-tripathi-26b64a222  
DataPulse is a powerful, Streamlit-based data analysis platform designed to streamline the end-to-end workflow from data ingestion to professional reporting. Built with efficiency and user experience in mind, it leverages AI-driven insights and advanced analytics to empower users to uncover actionable insights from their data effortlessly.
üöÄ Overview
DataPulse automates complex data workflows, making it ideal for analysts, businesses, and researchers. It supports multi-file uploads, intelligent preprocessing, domain-specific analysis suggestions, parallel execution, interactive dashboards, and professional PDF reports. With a focus on privacy and performance, it ensures secure, client-side processing and fast results.
‚ú® Key Features

Seamless Data Ingestion: Drag-and-drop support for CSV/Excel files with automatic merging for multi-file datasets.
Smart Preprocessing: Handles missing values, outliers, scaling, and sensitive data anonymization (e.g., emails, SSNs).
AI-Powered Suggestions: Detects data domains (time series, numeric, categorical) to recommend tailored analyses.
Parallel Analysis Execution: Runs multiple analyses concurrently (e.g., descriptive stats, anomaly detection, clustering) with real-time progress tracking.
Dynamic Dashboards: Interactive visualizations using Plotly, with filters and AI-generated insights powered by local LLMs (Ollama).
Professional Reporting: Exports comprehensive PDF reports with embedded charts and concise summaries.
Demo Mode: Test with sample datasets to explore features without uploading data.

üõ°Ô∏è Privacy & Security

Client-Side Processing: Ensures data stays in-memory for small datasets, enhancing privacy.
PII Anonymization: Automatically hashes sensitive fields (e.g., emails, phone numbers) using SHA-256.
Secure Configuration: Manages API keys via Streamlit‚Äôs secrets.toml for safe integration with external services.

üõ†Ô∏è Technical Stack

Frontend: Streamlit for responsive, user-friendly interfaces.
Backend: Python 3.8+, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn for data processing and machine learning.
Visualization: Plotly for interactive charts; ReportLab for PDF generation.
AI Integration: Ollama for local, low-latency insight generation (e.g., Llama 3.2 for summaries).
Dependencies: Listed in requirements.txt (includes streamlit, pandas, ollama, plotly, etc.).

üì¶ Installation
Prerequisites

Python 3.8 or higher
Ollama installed for local AI inference (download here)
4GB+ RAM for optimal performance (8GB+ recommended for larger datasets)

Steps

Clone the Repository:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/datapulse.git
cd datapulse


Install Dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt


Set Up Ollama:

Install Ollama and pull a model:ollama pull llama3.2:3b
ollama serve


Ensure the server runs at http://localhost:11434.


Run the Application:
streamlit run main.py



üöÄ Usage

Upload Data: Drag-and-drop CSV/Excel files or use demo mode with sample sales data.
Preprocess: Automatically clean and prepare data (handles duplicates, missing values, outliers).
Analyze: Select from AI-suggested analyses (e.g., time series, regression, clustering).
Visualize: Explore interactive dashboards with filters and AI-generated insights.
Export: Generate professional PDF reports with visualizations and summaries.

Performance Note: Optimized for datasets up to 10,000 rows. For larger datasets, expect minor delays (addressed with data sampling and local AI).
üåü Example Workflow

Upload a sales dataset (e.g., 100 rows of dates, sales, categories).
Preprocess to scale numeric columns and impute missing values.
Select analyses like "Correlation Analysis" and "Anomaly Detection."
View dynamic dashboard with scatter plots and AI insights (e.g., "Sales spike in Q2, review pricing strategy").
Export a PDF report with embedded charts and a concise summary.

üõ†Ô∏è Deployment
Deploy DataPulse on cloud platforms for broader access:

Streamlit Community Cloud: Share via share.streamlit.io.
Heroku/AWS/Azure: Configure with secrets management for secure API handling.
Local Hosting: Run on a local server for private, high-performance use.

üìö Future Enhancements

Integration with cloud databases (e.g., Google BigQuery) for real-time data.
Advanced anomaly detection with streaming data support.
Customizable dashboard themes and export formats (e.g., PPTX, HTML).
